# Policy-Decomposition

Policy Decomposition is a framework for computing control policies for complex optimal control problems by breaking them down into lower dimensional ones. Given a dynamical system and an objective function prescribing the desired behavior, Policy Decomposition proposes multiple strategies to decompose the problem and computes a suboptimality estimate to rank them. Promising decomposition strategies identified through this process result in substantial reduction in policy compute times while sacrificing minimally on the solution quality.
